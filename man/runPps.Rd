\title{Run the PPS Algorithm to Identify Pregnancy Episodes}
\usage{
runPps(
  cdm,
  outputDir,
  startDate = as.Date("1900-01-01"),
  endDate = Sys.Date(),
  logger = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cdm}{A `cdm_reference` object; must include all OMOP tables and structure needed for pregnancy concept search.}

\item{outputDir}{Character. Directory path where intermediate and output RDS files will be saved.}

\item{startDate}{Date (`Date(1)`). Earliest clinical date to be considered for gestational timing evidence (default: `"1900-01-01"`).}

\item{endDate}{Date (`Date(1)`). Latest clinical date to be considered for gestational timing evidence (default: `Sys.Date()`).}

\item{logger}{Optional `log4r` logger object for emitting information and debug messages.}
}
\value{
Returns the input `cdm_reference` invisibly, possibly modified with intermediate tables in its environment.
        Main results are side effects: RDS files with person-level gestational timing episodes and summary statistics are written to `outputDir`.
}
\description{
This function executes the Pregnancy Progression Signature (PPS) algorithm against a Common Data Model (CDM) instance.
It inserts the required PPS concept lookup table, extracts gestational timing evidence (e.g., gestational weeks, trimesters) across OMOP clinical domains,
assembles person-level gestational timing records, and writes intermediate episode and summary files to the specified output directory.
