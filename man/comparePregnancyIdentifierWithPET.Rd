\usage{
comparePregnancyIdentifierWithPET(
  cdm,
  outputDir,
  outputFolder,
  petSchema,
  petTable,
  minOverlapDays = 1L,
  logger = NULL,
  outputLogToConsole = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cdm}{A \code{cdm_reference} (from CDMConnector) with a database connection.
The PET table is read via \code{petSchema} and \code{petTable}.}

\item{outputDir}{\code{character(1)}. Directory containing pipeline outputs, in
particular \code{final_pregnancy_episodes.rds}.}

\item{outputFolder}{\code{character(1)}. Directory where comparison CSVs and
optional plots will be written. Created if it does not exist.}

\item{petSchema}{\code{character(1)}. Schema name of the PET table (e.g.
\code{"omop_cmbd"}).}

\item{petTable}{\code{character(1)}. Table name of the pregnancy episode table
(e.g. \code{"pregnancy_episode"}). Must contain at least \code{person_id},
\code{pregnancy_start_date}, \code{pregnancy_end_date}, and
\code{pregnancy_outcome} (concept_id).}

\item{minOverlapDays}{\code{integer(1)}. Minimum overlap in days to consider an
algorithm episode and a PET episode as the same pregnancy (default 1).}

\item{logger}{Optional \code{log4r::logger}. If \code{NULL}, a logger is
created via \code{makeLogger(outputFolder)}.}

\item{outputLogToConsole}{\code{logical(1)}. Used only when \code{logger} is
\code{NULL}. Whether to log to the console as well as to the log file.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with elements \code{episode_counts},
  \code{venn_counts}, \code{confusion_2x2}, \code{ppv_sensitivity},
  \code{date_differences}, \code{outcome_confusion}, \code{outcome_accuracy},
  \code{duration_summary}, and \code{duration_distribution}. \code{confusion_2x2}
  is the 2x2 table (TP, FN, FP, TN; TN is \code{NA} at episode level).
  \code{ppv_sensitivity} contains sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV
  (specificity and NPV are \code{NA} when TN is not defined). All comparison
  artifacts are also written to \code{outputFolder} as CSVs (and optionally PNGs).
}
\description{
Compares algorithm output (from \code{final_pregnancy_episodes.rds}) to the PET
table and writes comparison summaries to \code{outputFolder}. Comparisons include:
pregnancy episode and person counts; pregnancy start/end date differences for
linked episodes; Venn counts (both, PET only, algorithm only); a 2x2 confusion
matrix (TP, FN, FP, TN) with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV; outcome
confusion matrix and accuracy; and pregnancy duration distributions.
