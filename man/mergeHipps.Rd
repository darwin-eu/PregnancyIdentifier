\title{Merge HIP and PPS episodes into a unified HIPPS episode table}
\usage{
mergeHipps(outputDir, logger)
}
\arguments{
\item{outputDir}{(`character(1)`) Directory containing intermediate RDS artifacts:
`PPS_min_max_episodes.rds`, `PPS_gest_timing_episodes.rds`, `HIP_episodes.rds`.}

\item{logger}{(`logger`) log4r logger.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns `NULL` and writes `HIPPS_episodes.rds` to `outputDir`.
}
\description{
Reads previously-saved HIP and PPS outputs from `outputDir`,
merges HIP and PPS episodes based on temporal overlap, resolves many-to-many overlaps
by selecting the best-matching pairs, and returns a single per-person episode table
with standardized columns used downstream by ESD and reporting.
}
\details{
Key steps:
\itemize{
  \item Load HIP episodes and PPS episodes from `outputDir`
  \item Merge HIP + PPS episodes by overlap; flag episodes involved in many-to-many overlaps
  \item Resolve many-to-many overlaps by selecting best-matching pairs (retain best matches by end-date proximity and episode plausibility)
  \item Add standardized columns and per-person episode ordering; write `HIPPS_episodes.rds`
}
}
