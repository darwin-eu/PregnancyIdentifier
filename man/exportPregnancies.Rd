\title{Export pregnancy results into shareable summary CSVs}
\usage{
exportPregnancies(cdm, outputDir, exportDir, minCellCount = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{cdm}{(`cdm_reference`) CDM reference used to compute exports that require
database tables (e.g., `person`, `observation_period`).}

\item{outputDir}{(`character(1)`) Directory containing `runHipps()` outputs
(e.g., `identified_pregancy_episodes.rds`, logs, PPS concept counts).}

\item{exportDir}{(`character(1)`) Directory where shareable CSVs (and ZIP) will
be written.}

\item{minCellCount}{(`integer(1)`) Minimum count threshold for suppression of
small cells (default 5). Values in (0, minCellCount) are replaced with `NA`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns `NULL`. Writes CSVs and a ZIP file to `exportDir`.
}
\description{
Reads the patient-level pregnancy episode results produced by `runHipps()` (from
`outputDir`), generates a set of de-identified summary tables (counts, age
summaries, timing distributions, outcome counts, and date completeness checks),
writes them to `exportDir`, and creates a ZIP archive of all exported files.
}
\details{
The export is intended for lightweight QA and sharing across sites. Small cell
counts can be suppressed via `minCellCount`.
