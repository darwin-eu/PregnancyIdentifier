DARWIN EU® - PeriNet - Objective 2: Optimising and validating OMOP pregnancy algorithms for data sources with pregnancy-related data within the DARWIN EU® Data Network

**Research question**

Can algorithm-based inference of pregnancy episodes and outcomes be reliably applied across different populations and healthcare settings within the DARWIN EU® Data Network?

**Study objectives**

This study aims to evaluate the reliability of inferring pregnancy episodes and their outcomes using algorithms applied within the DARWIN EU® Data Network.

The specific objectives of this study are:

* 2.1 To describe existing published pregnancy algorithms that have been applied in data sources mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). 

* 2.2 To assess the availability of the required input variables for the identified pregnancy algorithms across the selected DARWIN EU® data sources.

* 2.3 To implement the identified pregnancy algorithm(s) in the selected DARWIN EU® data sources and adapt for initial execution, accounting for data availability. 

* 2.4 To iteratively evaluate the internal consistency and plausibility of the performance of the selected pregnancy algorithms. 

* 2.5 To optimise the pregnancy algorithms in the selected DARWIN EU® data sources (based on results from Objective 4). 

* 2.6 To validate the algorithm’s performance at the episode-level and population-level within the DARWIN EU® Data Network.
